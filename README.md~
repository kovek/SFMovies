To set up the database, run xmltosqlite.py on this directory. It will process filmLocations.csv to create xmlsqlite.db3

To get the server runnning:
$/var/www/uberProject/: . venv/bin/activate
$/var/www/uberProject/: python main.py

Steps I've taken to generate the database:
1. Download the xml file from: https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am
2. Download this xmltosqlite converter: https://gist.github.com/roder/743047 
3. Run $/var/www/uberProjectHeroku/: python xmltosqlite.py . 
4. $: sqlite3 xmlsqlite.db3 
5. 	>alter table main.row add 'lat' REAL;
6. 	>alter table main.row add 'lon' REAL;
7. Then, I wrote a small file which geolocates all of the addresses and inputs them into the database: $: geolocate.py

I made three simple tests as a proof of concept for the back-end
To test main.py, just run: $ python main_tests.py

An imporvement that could be made in the app would be to have the markers which represent multiples movies have a title as a list of those movies names. For example, there were many movies filmed on the Golden Gate Bridge. So, the title of the marker on the GGB could be all of those movies' names.
